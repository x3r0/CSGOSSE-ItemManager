open csgo_items.txt and edit it there
execute csgo_items_generator.bat

This thing cannot edit, only append to existing item file or create new item. If you want to append to your items.bin file, edit csgo_items_generator.bat and delete the delete command and put your items.bin there.

The csgo_items.txt format as follow:
id, inventory, quality, rarity, level, def_index, {attrs}
id and inventory = set this to zero, it will be assigned by the emu and the game
def_index = item type, it can be weapon, coin, sticker, music kit, etc... see csgo/scripts/items/items_game.txt
next to it is array of attributes, also see items_game.txt for list of available attributes for items

It represent the number, from 1 to 400~ "paint_kits" in float. (See items_game.txt under paint_kits section)

So 2 = 0x40000000, 3 = 0x40400000 and so on. You can convert them here: http://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html

Example aq_obsidian = 266 (decimal) = 0x43850000 (float) = 0x00 0x00 0x85 0x43 (le), weapon_fiveseven = 3. You will write like this:
0 0 0 0 0 3 6=00008543

The id and inventory must be set to zero, it will be set later by the emulator and the game.
The quality is under "qualities" tag, there is normal (0), genuine (1), vintage (2), etc...
Rarity is under "rarities" tag, there is default(0), common(1), uncommon(2), etc...
Level is 1 by default, I don't know what actually is level means.
item is item id, see under "items" tag.
{attributes} is collection of attribute, can be found under "attributes" section.

attributes valid for weapon:
6 (texture) = float value, see under paint_kits tag
7 (texture seed) = float value, this value can be any number
8 (texture wear) = float value, usually this value below 0.1, you don't want it to wear badly. Example 0.005304
80 (kill eater) = stattrak
81 (score) = stattrak
113 (sticker) = "sticker_kits"
114 (sticker wear), float value, range is from 0 to 1.

attribute valid for music kit (1314):
166 (music id) = "music_definitions" tag

attribute valid for sticker (1209):
113 (sticker) = "sticker_kits"
